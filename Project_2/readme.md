The only thing that needs to be run for this project is Project2.ipynb. This Jupyter Notebook contains all the code for the different parts of the assignment.

You will need to have the following dependincies installed:
1. Gym from OpenAi
2. PyTorch
3. NumPy
4. Collections

After Having these installed the Jupyter Notebook should run smoothly.
